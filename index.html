	<p> Saw others giving intros and thought this would be one cool way to do it, 
	well, hello GDSC. <p>
	<p> I am Sukalyan Roy from CSE First year. <p>
	<p> Speaking of programming, I can write hello world in atleast 5 languages but that's about it<p>
	<p> Currently struggling through week 5 of CS50. Want to learn Lisp next. <p>
	<p> I hope that i'll learn alot from this club and it will be a good community for us students for the next four years and beyond.<p>
	<p> PS: I'm still a noob in this, don't let this poorly written static site be a reflection of my final skills. <p>
